        Beats Electronics LLC (also known as Beats by Dr. Dre, or simply Beats
        by Dre) is an American consumer audio products manufacturer
        headquartered in Culver City, California.[1][2] The company was founded
        by music producer Dr. Dre and record company executive Jimmy Iovine.
        Since 2014, it has been an Apple subsidiary. The subsidiary's product
        line is primarily focused on headphones and speakers. The company's
        original product line was manufactured in partnership with the AV
        equipment company Monster Cable Products. Following the end of its
        contract with the company, Beats took further development of its
        products in-house. In 2014, the company expanded into the online music
        market with the launch of a subscription-based streaming service, Beats
        Music. In 2011, NPD Group reported that Beats' market share was 64% in
        the U.S. for headphones priced higher than $100, and the brand was
        valued at $1 billion in September 2013.[3][4] For a period, the company
        was majority-owned by Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC. The company
        reduced its stake to 25% in 2012, and sold its remaining stake back to
        the company in 2013. Concurrently, Carlyle Group replaced HTC as a
        minority shareholder, alongside Dr. Dre and Iovine in late 2013. On
        August 1, 2014, Apple acquired Beats for $3 billion in a cash and stock
        deal, the largest acquisition in Apple's history.
